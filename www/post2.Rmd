Chapter One of *Data Feminism* delves into the work of an influential sociologist by the name of Patricia Hill Collins. In her pivotal work titled *Black Feminist Thought*, Collins introduces the idea of the _matrix of domination_ to conceptualize how systems of power are organized and subsequently experienced.^[https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/vi8obxh7/release/3] It is important to note that the term "matrix of domination" was developed by Collins to articulate the intersectional oppression that specifically Black women experience.

This particular chapter in *Data Feminism* also describes the power that many large tech companies hold through profiting off of massive amounts of user data and wildly benefitting from the U.S government and economy's capitalist structure. In these same companies, the task of instilling ethics and harboring safer environments for minoritized groups almost always fall on the members of the minoritized groups themselves. It is more than apparent that the matrix of domination intricately plays in these large companies and can be applied in similar ways to explain the intersectional experiences of all minoritized groups. After discussing this topic in a breakout room with class peers earlier this week, we left with the unanswered question: *How do we stand against the practices and work environments of these large corporations (and ultimately the capitalist structure of society that we must endure) in a meaningful and impactful way? In other words, are we "selling out" by staying at these companies?*

It is difficult to either decide to leave your position or not work for these companies in the first place. The ability to do this implies a level of job security that some do not have. Additionally, the software engineering salaries that these companies offer are well into the six-figure range^[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/how-much-google-facebook-other-tech-giants-pay-software-engineers.html], so going anywhere else would likely mean a large paycut. Even if you made the decision to leave one of these companies for ethical reasons, there will always be another candidate waiting to fill your spot. This puts so many minoritized people in this industry in a moral "checkmate", so well-explained by the matrix of domination, where structurally and disciplinarily, minoritized individuals and allies are left with no good options for stimulating any kind of active systemic change in these company environments.

So, how do we begin ethical reform in these companies? From a base level, it needs to come from both the privatized industry as well as the U.S. federal government to dismantle the perpetuation of capitalist idelologies as an excuse for competitive innovation. In respect to the required strength of the resistance, Patricia Hill Collins puts it best:  
**"If power as domination is organized and operates via intersecting oppressions, then resistance must show comparable complexity."^[*Black Feminist Thought, 1990*, https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/black-feminist-though-by-patricia-hill-collins.pdf]**
